        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I am a highly motivated person who enjoys learning. I am detail
          oriented, focused on identifying problems and designing and building
          solutions to them. I highly value teamwork and getting along with
          others. I consider pressured time as a challenge, not as a difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>I possess skills in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
        <p>
          In high school, I developed teamwork and leadership skills by being
          the first team captain of our chess team.
